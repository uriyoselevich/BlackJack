"# BlackJack" 


Hey ALL
This is a very simple version of BlackJack as part of my python OOP experiments...

It is a one-player-one-dealer format and the dealer is tough....

It is great fun for passing time or to use as a template for further development.

If you wish to learn python it is a great example of how to start using classes and objects within a knowen game

Good luck!
